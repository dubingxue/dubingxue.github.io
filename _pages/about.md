I'm currently a 3rd year Ph.D student at [School of Life Sciences, Northwestern Polytechnical University](https://shengming.nwpu.edu.cn/Home.htm), supervised by Prof. [Jian-Yu Shi](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jian-Yu-Shi). I am also a visiting student at [Institute for Infocomm Research (I2R), Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A * STAR)](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/i2r), supervised by Dr. [Min Wu](https://sites.google.com/site/wumincf/home). Previously, I received the Master's degree from the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS) in 2020 and the Bachelor's degree from Chang'an University in 2017.

Research Interests
======
My primary research interests include deep learning, graph neural networks and AI for drug discovery and development. The specific topics I have focused on and published several papers as first author on various sequential tasks in drug candidate screening, including compound-protein interaction prediction (Du et al., **Drug Discovery Today**, 2022), drug metabolic pathway prediction (Du et al., **ISMB 2022 & Bioinformatics**) , drug pharmacokinetics and safety (ADMET) prediction (Du et al., **RECOMB 2023**) and drug metabolic stability prediction (Du et al., **Bioinformatics**, 2023). These researches are highly expected to obtain reliable drug candidates and speed up the process of drug discovery.

In particularly, I won the [Outstanding Student Paper Honorable Mention](https://www.iscb.org/ismb2022-general-info/award-winners) of Ian Lawson Van Toch Memorial Award granted by **the Princess Margaret Cancer Foundation** in ISMB 2022 conference. I have a dream and a strong interest to be as excellent as Ian Lawson Van Toch and to make new breakthroughs in drug discovery or other cutting-edge issues in computational biology in the future.
